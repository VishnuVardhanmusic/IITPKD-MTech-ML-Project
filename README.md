## AGRI â€“ CROP  PREDICTOR  

## Basic Problem Statement 
Given a dataset (Crop_recommendation.csv) which would allow the users to 
build a predictive model to recommend the most suitable crops to grow in a 
particular farm based on various parameters. This dataset was built by 
augmenting datasets of rainfall, climate and fertilizer data available for India.

We need to perform suitable data preprocessing techniques to grab the data 
insights and inferences. Concise data analysis to be done on the features of the 
datasets via finding correlations and interdependencies. Plot the insights with 
appropriate charts. Examine the learning algorithms performances to the given 
input. Suggest what changes to be done to the hyperparameters so that the 
accuracy gets enhanced. Illustrate real time predictions by the built model.
